Description
	This program is two fold. The first part is a data science based on how graphs can be created.
The data is copied into the program and is removed of any duplicate information so that it prevents any confusion in the data's csv file.
Lines 29 to 34 Is where we can label the information to fit in a readable fashion instead of 0 and 1 for no and yes. 
myplotlib, seaborn, and pandas are the three main inported libraries in working of graph creation.
Each having a hand in either labeling the graph or actually showing the graph. The information for the graphs is in the 
heart.csv file. The second part of the program is the webpage and HTML part of the project. 
The HTML Coding povides the links and formatting of the websites. It handles everything from the text formating to the background color.
Each graph from the data science part of this project has its own subsite through the HTML links. Once the project is running the Flask port link will show
all the information that was inputed into the HTML coding and is called through the @app.route part of the code in each specified route.
Example the @app.route ("/age") will show the age graph through the HTML port /age . This can organize any set and subsets of data in a website through local ports.
